# Basic Bioinformatics Scripts

This repository contains a collection of bioinformatics scripts useful for common tasks.

## Scripts

### biopython_basics.ipynb
`biopython_basics.ipynb` provides an introduction to using Biopython for various basic tasks.

#### Features:
- Accessing NCBI databases with Entrez
- Downloading a FASTA file and saving it to Google Drive
- Calculating the number of bases in a sequence
- Obtaining the complement or reverse complement of a DNA sequence
- Translating sequences of DNA/RNA

### exploratory_analysis.ipynb
`exploratory_analysis.ipynb` is a Colab notebook demonstrating one approach to exploratory data analysis of microbiome sequencing data.

#### Features:
- Exploring data distribution using histograms and box plots
- Visualizing differences in taxonomic composition with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)
- Statistical testing with PERMANOVA

 ### power_analysis.ipynb
`power_analysis.ipynb` contains code for conducting power analysis during experimental design.

#### Features:
- Estimate effect size (Cohen's d)
- Determine the sample size required for a desired power
- Visualize power across a range of sample sizes
- Calculate the minimum detectable effect size for a certain sample size
